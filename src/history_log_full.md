A massive Automaton Invasion Fleet, comprising tens of thousands of warships, arrived from FTL jump to the Valdis Sector and overran nearly every planet in just hours. Attacks on communications networks delayed warning until now. SEAF reserves are scrambling. All Helldivers are called to deploy immediately to the defense. This Fleet dwarfs the Automaton armies destroyed in Operation Swift Disassembly. As we predicted from the start, they were merely a vanguard. This is the Automatons' true force. Where the Automatons hid this fleet, and what their true intentions are—those questions must be answered later. The Reclamation has begun. (2024-04-09 23:47)<br/>

Dispatch: MAJOR ORDER WON. Valiant work, Helldivers. Thanks to your noble efforts, millions of tons of Terminid biomass has been rendered safe for collection, and is being processed into Element 710 as we speak.

We now have the logistical means to enable and sustain an effective counter-offensive against the Automatons. Soon, we will take back lands they stole. (2024-04-19 10:54)<br/>
Dispatch: In further proof of their elite training and irreplaceable value, the Helldivers reached the target set for Terminid biomass production far faster than anticipated. While additional destruction of Liberty's enemies is always beneficial, E-710 refinement pipelines are full at the present time.
