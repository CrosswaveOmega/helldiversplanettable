Dispatch: CYBERSECURITY UPDATE. A recent systems security breach has resulted in Galactic War tables displaying inaccurate information.

Dispatch: INTELLIGENCE BRIEF. A new strain of flying Terminids has suddenly appeared across all Terminid planets, with no prior warning or indication of any kind. While the Ministry of Intelligence has always known this was a possibility, the abruptness of the evolution indicates a high possibility of dissident concealment. The deployment of Termicide was fortuitously timed—doubtlessly, it averted an even worse evolution. Helldivers are advised to exterminate these mutations whenever encountered.

This Fleet dwarfs the Automaton armies destroyed in Operation Swift Disassembly. As we predicted from the start, they were merely a vanguard. This is the Automatons' true force. Where the Automatons hid this fleet, and what their true intentions are—those questions must be answered later. The Reclamation has begun. (2024-04-09 23:47  UTC)<br/>

Dispatch: NEW MAJOR ORDER. Thanks to the valiant and unceasing defense of the Helldivers, a robust defensive line has been established. This is likely only a temporary respite, while the bots refit in preparation to break through our defenses once more. We now have the opportunity to refuel our war effort. The defense effort depleted our E-710 reserves. In order to allow for a counter-offensive, the Helldivers are ordered to manually produce Terminid corpses for conversion into E-710.

### Day: #72
Dispatch: MAJOR ORDER WON. Valiant work, Helldivers. Thanks to your noble efforts, millions of tons of Terminid biomass has been rendered safe for collection, and is being processed into Element 710 as we speak. This surplus of fuel will enable the transport of weapons, equipment, and personnel to the frontlines of the Automaton fight. We now have the logistical means to enable and sustain an effective counter-offensive against the Automatons. Soon, we will take back lands they stole. (2024-04-19 10:54  UTC)<br/>
Dispatch: In further proof of their elite training and irreplaceable value, the Helldivers reached the target set for Terminid biomass production far faster than anticipated. While additional destruction of Liberty's enemies is always beneficial, E-710 refinement pipelines are full at the present time. However, there will be ample opportunities for additional biomass production in the future. *Super Earth* High Command commends the Helldivers for their boundless enthusiasm to destroy the enemies of Freedom.

Dispatch: OPERATION "ENDURING PEACE"—PHASE II (FINAL). The time has come to eradicate the Terminid Supercolony completely. The Helldivers will deploy to the surface of *Meridia* to deploy partial payloads of Dark Fluid across the planet. Once a critical mass is reached, the Dark Fluid will accrete into a superdense mass, triggering total planetary implosion. The Supercolony, and its hyper-reproductive Terminids, will be destroyed. The fate of the galaxy is in your hands, Helldivers. (2024-05-30 15:39  UTC)<br/>

Dispatch: BRIEFING. Efforts to expand the arsenal of chemical deterrents have been interrupted by an uptick in colonial labor shrinkage. While investigations are underway, these unforecasted population reductions have caused a resource shortfall. Specifically, mass production of new MD-8 Gas Mines is currently bottlenecked by chlorine shortages. Military intervention is now required. The Ministry of Expansion has identified several planets as rich in easily-accessible salt deposits, which can be mined rapidly for subsequent conversion to chlorine. The Helldivers are ordered to reclaim these planets from our enemies. If all planets can be secured within the specified timeframe, the MD-8 Gas Mines will be made available for immediate requisition in all Super Destroyers. (2024-12-05 17:02  UTC)<br/>
