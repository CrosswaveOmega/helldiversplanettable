Intercepted bot chatter includes expressions of great sorrow for the "murder" of in-development bots—a transparent attempt at disinformation, as bots can neither feel nor be considered alive. However, the simulated oaths of vengeance may indicate actual strategic intent. A counteroffensive is likely. (2024-04-01 13:00  UTC)<br/>

Dispatch: NEW MAJOR ORDER. Several weeks ago, our citizens watched in horror as *Malevelon Creek* fell to the Automatons. Millions of valiant heroes perished attempting to defend it. For too long, the bots have maintained their illegal occupation, desecrating the memory of the fallen by rapidly depleting the planet's exceptionally rich rhodium deposits.

Attacks on communications networks delayed warning until now. SEAF reserves are scrambling. All Helldivers are called to deploy immediately to the defense. This Fleet dwarfs the Automaton armies destroyed in Operation Swift Disassembly. As we predicted from the start, they were merely a vanguard. This is the Automatons' true force.

Dispatch: MAJOR ORDER WON. The defense held. The *Menkent* Line has been established. The Automaton advance has been arrested. Rudimentary orbital defenses have been established along the line, and are being augmented by hardworking SEAF and civilian laborers. Meanwhile, the SEAF Forward Command Base on *Vernen Wells* is up and running, providing fresh recruits and supplies to the front. (2024-04-16 12:09  UTC)<br/>

Dispatch: NEW MAJOR ORDER. With the *Menkent* Line established, the Automaton Fleet has been forced to divert their plans. Now, they are attempting a concerted effort to punch through at a single planet. The Automatons are likely to muster the entirety of their strength for this endeavor. You must outlast the enemy. Hold the planet, no matter the cost. (2024-04-16 15:17  UTC)<br/>
Dispatch: INTELLIGENCE BRIEF. The Automatons have deployed a new heavy unit: the Factory Strider. Previously deployed in very limited quantities, likely prototypes, this massive abomination is a walking Automaton fabricator. It is heavily armed and armored, and should be engaged with coordinated firepower and unhesitating aggression. (2024-04-16 16:10  UTC)<br/>

Dispatch: MAJOR ORDER WON. The Automaton Invasion Fleet has been repelled. The bots committed much of their reserves to this attack. Even the large-scale deployment of the Factory Strider could not break the resolve of the Helldivers. The situation remains dire. The Automatons still illegally occupy vast swaths of our territory. But with this victory, the Helldivers have won the opportunity to turn back the tide. (2024-04-18 07:51  UTC)<br/>

Dispatch: NEW MAJOR ORDER. Thanks to the valiant and unceasing defense of the Helldivers, a robust defensive line has been established. This is likely only a temporary respite, while the bots refit in preparation to break through our defenses once more. We now have the opportunity to refuel our war effort. The defense effort depleted our E-710 reserves. In order to allow for a counter-offensive, the Helldivers are ordered to manually produce Terminid corpses for conversion into E-710.

### Day: #72
Dispatch: MAJOR ORDER WON. Valiant work, Helldivers. Thanks to your noble efforts, millions of tons of Terminid biomass has been rendered safe for collection, and is being processed into Element 710 as we speak. This surplus of fuel will enable the transport of weapons, equipment, and personnel to the frontlines of the Automaton fight. We now have the logistical means to enable and sustain an effective counter-offensive against the Automatons. Soon, we will take back lands they stole. (2024-04-19 10:54  UTC)<br/>
Dispatch: In further proof of their elite training and irreplaceable value, the Helldivers reached the target set for Terminid biomass production far faster than anticipated. While additional destruction of Liberty's enemies is always beneficial, E-710 refinement pipelines are full at the present time. However, there will be ample opportunities for additional biomass production in the future. *Super Earth* High Command commends the Helldivers for their boundless enthusiasm to destroy the enemies of Freedom.

Dispatch: NEW MAJOR ORDER. Freedom is under attack once more. In an act of sinister syncronicity, both the Terminids and Automatons have launched large-scale assaults. The Helldivers must now defend our citizens on two fronts at once. (2024-04-19 15:07  UTC)<br/>

Dispatch: INTEL BRIEF. Spore production on the *Meridia* Supercolony has doubled overnight, indicating continued evolution of the Terminid threat. Increased Terminid outbreaks on nearby planets is highly likely. Helldivers are advised to exercise extreme vigilance in stamping out these outbreaks, lest they spread out of control. (2024-05-26 15:00  UTC)<br/>
*Heeth* of the Orion sector is attacked by Lvl 12 Terminids (2024-05-26 15:03  UTC)<br/>

Dispatch: STRATEGIC UPDATE. Enemy aggression on both fronts remains unrelenting. In particular, the Supercolony on *Meridia* is fueling an unprecedented surge in Terminid infestation rates. The Automatons grow in power as well, continuing their unjust invasion. Our analysts are certain that nothing could have forestalled this dire situation, save perhaps the timely employment of MD-17 Anti-Tank Mines. Scientists on *Moradesh* are making progress on a way to combat the Supercolony. That will be Liberty's salvation. Until then, the Helldivers must hold the line at all costs.

Dispatch: NEW MAJOR ORDER. The DSS will require the construction of the Deep Mantle Forge Complex, which will use extreme heat and pressure near a planet's core to create large quantities of new, powerful alloy. We have identified atmospheric readings on *Claorell* indicating the Automatons are already engaging in deep-mantle mining operations on the planet. The Helldivers are directed to liberate *Claorell* and its deep-mantle mining complex from the Automatons. (2024-10-04 13:14  UTC)<br/>

Dispatch: MAJOR ORDER UPDATE. The Helldivers have won battles in the effort to secure *Acamar IV*. The Defense of *Achird III*, won on a razor's edge, has been recognized by High Command as a show of valor not seen since the Battle of *Mort* in the first days of the war. Achird stands, as does Freedom. But the fight is not yet over. Readings indicate imminent Terminid invasions of the defensive ring. Hold the line, so the Terminid Research Preserve can be built.

Dispatch: SYSTEMS NOTIFICATION. Some Galactic Map users may have observed the apparent presence of enemy forces occupying dozens of planets. This issue was due to an unconcerning software glitch that has since been rectified. This experience may have given rise to some uncomfortable feelings, such as concern, terror, or abject despair. Distressed users are advised to visualize relaxing images, such as: -a fluttering *Super Earth* flag -a filled-out ballot -the inevitable destruction of Freedom's enemies.

Dispatch: BRIEFING. Efforts to expand the arsenal of chemical deterrents have been interrupted by an uptick in colonial labor shrinkage. While investigations are underway, these unforecasted population reductions have caused a resource shortfall. Specifically, mass production of new MD-8 Gas Mines is currently bottlenecked by chlorine shortages. Military intervention is now required. The Ministry of Expansion has identified several planets as rich in easily-accessible salt deposits, which can be mined rapidly for subsequent conversion to chlorine. The Helldivers are ordered to reclaim these planets from our enemies. If all planets can be secured within the specified timeframe, the MD-8 Gas Mines will be made available for immediate requisition in all Super Destroyers. (2024-12-05 17:02  UTC)<br/>

With every invasion, the Illuminate appear to be siphoning off more of this exotic force. The purpose of their actions remains unknown. By measuring spacetime fluctuations, the Ministry of Science is able to estimate how much Dark Energy is being stolen. Trackers on all Galactic Maps have been updated accordingly.

Dispatch: NEW MAJOR ORDER. Analysis of gravitational waves has revealed that the Illuminate are sending accumulated Dark Energy directly into the Singularity itself. If that flow can be restricted, the Singularity can be slowed significantly. High Command has therefore ordered the establishment of a blockade surrounding the Meridian Singularity.  The Helldivers are ordered to aid in resource gathering for the fielding of this massive blockade fleet. Consult your Galactic Map for more details. (2025-03-07 15:34  UTC)<br/>
Dispatch: STRATEGIC ALERT. Supply chain difficulties of an obtuse and tedious nature have caused significant fixed-wing armament shortages, increasing Eagle Re-Arm times by 30% fleetwide. The issue will shortly resolve itself and return to normal. However, rapid liberation of the Terminid-infested planet BORE ROCK would provide us a supply node that would reverse the effect, causing Eagle Re-Arm times to be 50% faster for the remainder of the order.

Dispatch: NEW STRATEGIC OPPORTUNITY. As the DSS must be augmented to strike at the Gloom, so must our arsenal. Old weapon materials remain on VARYLIA 5, ready for seizing. The stout-hearted citizens of the Jolly Weapons Workhands' Extracurricular Initiative are eager to convert these materials to materiel; liberating this planet will grant Helldivers additional Exosuit. Additionally, signs that the Illuminate are storing Dark Fluid on OASIS make this planet a prime target as well; if the stockpiles can be seized, they can be used to create additional Warp Packs. Only one of these initiatives can be prioritized. (2025-09-26 10:05  UTC)<br/>

Dispatch: NEW STRATEGIC THREAT. Enemy resistance on *Oshaune* has spiked, precipitated by an unexpectedly high amount of Hive Lords. SEAF forces have been devastated. The Helldivers are ordered to kill 50,000 Hive Lords to bring enemy resistance back down. (2025-11-01 01:20  UTC)<br/>

Dispatch: DSS STATUS CRITICAL. The anti-spore polymer shielding on the DSS is critically degraded following prolonged Gloom exposure. The station remains operational, but should it remain in Gloom space much longer, it will suffer a severe breakdown, requiring weeks to repair. Moving the DSS now to KARLIA to re-apply the polymer coating would prevent this damage. The Helldivers must decide whether to take the DSS out of the action on *Oshaune*, or risk lasting damage to the station. (2025-11-01 22:46  UTC)<br/>
