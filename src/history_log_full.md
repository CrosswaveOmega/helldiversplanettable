Dispatch: CYBERSECURITY UPDATE. A recent systems security breach has resulted in Galactic War tables displaying inaccurate information.

Dispatch: INTELLIGENCE BRIEF. A new strain of flying Terminids has suddenly appeared across all Terminid planets, with no prior warning or indication of any kind.

The deployment of Termicide was fortuitously timed—doubtlessly, it averted an even worse evolution. Helldivers are advised to exterminate these mutations whenever encountered.

Attacks on communications networks delayed warning until now. SEAF reserves are scrambling. All Helldivers are called to deploy immediately to the defense. This Fleet dwarfs the Automaton armies destroyed in Operation Swift Disassembly. As we predicted from the start, they were merely a vanguard. This is the Automatons' true force.

Major Order | A1-4-8 Gather E-710 from 2B Terminids is issued | Objective: Eradicate (2024-04-18 10:31  UTC)<br/>
Dispatch: NEW MAJOR ORDER. Thanks to the valiant and unceasing defense of the Helldivers, a robust defensive line has been established. This is likely only a temporary respite, while the bots refit in preparation to break through our defenses once more. We now have the opportunity to refuel our war effort. The defense effort depleted our E-710 reserves. In order to allow for a counter-offensive, the Helldivers are ordered to manually produce Terminid corpses for conversion into E-710.

### Day: #72
Dispatch: MAJOR ORDER WON. Valiant work, Helldivers. Thanks to your noble efforts, millions of tons of Terminid biomass has been rendered safe for collection, and is being processed into Element 710 as we speak. This surplus of fuel will enable the transport of weapons, equipment, and personnel to the frontlines of the Automaton fight. We now have the logistical means to enable and sustain an effective counter-offensive against the Automatons. Soon, we will take back lands they stole. (2024-04-19 10:54  UTC)<br/>
Dispatch: In further proof of their elite training and irreplaceable value, the Helldivers reached the target set for Terminid biomass production far faster than anticipated. While additional destruction of Liberty's enemies is always beneficial, E-710 refinement pipelines are full at the present time. However, there will be ample opportunities for additional biomass production in the future. *Super Earth* High Command commends the Helldivers for their boundless enthusiasm to destroy the enemies of Freedom.

Dispatch: OPERATION "ENDURING PEACE"—PHASE II (FINAL). The time has come to eradicate the Terminid Supercolony completely. The Helldivers will deploy to the surface of *Meridia* to deploy partial payloads of Dark Fluid across the planet. Once a critical mass is reached, the Dark Fluid will accrete into a superdense mass, triggering total planetary implosion. The Supercolony, and its hyper-reproductive Terminids, will be destroyed. The fate of the galaxy is in your hands, Helldivers. (2024-05-30 15:39  UTC)<br/>

Dispatch: STRATEGIC REPORT. *Vernen Wells* has been liberated. SEAF forces have secured the Children's Hospital, and made contact with the civilians trapped underneath the rubble. The majority of the thousands of trapped civilians—including all 4,311 very sick children—are alive. Rescue operations are underway. Long-range imagery shows heavy Automaton transport activity on *Marfark*. The Anti-Tank Mine material has likely been moved far out of reach. (2024-06-14 13:55  UTC)<br/>
Dispatch: INTEL REPORT. The Automatons appear to have become aware of our efforts to liberate the Anti-Tank Mine materials on *Marfark*, and have initiated operations to transport the material off-planet. Within 24 hours, it will be too late to secure the materials. Workers at AT Mine Factories have been notified that their employment may be terminated. (2024-06-14 14:28  UTC)<br/>

Dispatch: BRIEFING. Efforts to expand the arsenal of chemical deterrents have been interrupted by an uptick in colonial labor shrinkage. While investigations are underway, these unforecasted population reductions have caused a resource shortfall. Specifically, mass production of new MD-8 Gas Mines is currently bottlenecked by chlorine shortages. Military intervention is now required. The Ministry of Expansion has identified several planets as rich in easily-accessible salt deposits, which can be mined rapidly for subsequent conversion to chlorine. The Helldivers are ordered to reclaim these planets from our enemies. If all planets can be secured within the specified timeframe, the MD-8 Gas Mines will be made available for immediate requisition in all Super Destroyers. (2024-12-05 17:02  UTC)<br/>

Dispatch: INTEL REPORT. The Ministry of Science has confirmed the proposed link between Illuminate activity and the disappearance of large swaths of Dark Energy from our Galaxy. With every invasion, the Illuminate appear to be siphoning off more of this exotic force. The purpose of their actions remains unknown. By measuring spacetime fluctuations, the Ministry of Science is able to estimate how much Dark Energy is being stolen. Trackers on all Galactic Maps have been updated accordingly.

The Ministry of Science's top astrophysicists are gathered there, researching both the Singularity itself and the Dark Energy that somehow powers its movement.

Dispatch: ALERT. A new Terminid strain, likely to have developed inside the Gloom, has been encountered near the Center of Science on *Fenrir III*.

Major Order | A2-3-2 Blockade the Singularity is issued | Objective: Eradicate (2025-03-07 15:34  UTC)<br/>
Dispatch: NEW MAJOR ORDER. Analysis of gravitational waves has revealed that the Illuminate are sending accumulated Dark Energy directly into the Singularity itself. If that flow can be restricted, the Singularity can be slowed significantly. High Command has therefore ordered the establishment of a blockade surrounding the Meridian Singularity.  The Helldivers are ordered to aid in resource gathering for the fielding of this massive blockade fleet. Consult your Galactic Map for more details. (2025-03-07 15:34  UTC)<br/>
Dispatch: STRATEGIC ALERT. Supply chain difficulties of an obtuse and tedious nature have caused significant fixed-wing armament shortages, increasing Eagle Re-Arm times by 30% fleetwide. The issue will shortly resolve itself and return to normal. However, rapid liberation of the Terminid-infested planet BORE ROCK would provide us a supply node that would reverse the effect, causing Eagle Re-Arm times to be 50% faster for the remainder of the order.

Dispatch: NEW MAJOR ORDER. Automaton forces have landed on multiple planets in what appears to be a coordinated, large-scale, craven assault. However, the Penrose Energy Siphon, which would significantly slow the Singularity's advance, is nearly ready for activation. High Command delegates to the Helldivers this choice: hold off the Automaton assault, or effect the immediate activation of the Penrose Energy Siphon. Consult your Galactic Map for more information.

Dispatch: MAJOR ORDER FAILED. Dauntless efforts by the Helldivers fell short of mission targets. But the righteousness of our cause has yielded an unequivocal victory nevertheless. Center of Science projections confirm that the Meridian Wormhole will slow to a complete halt in short order. Furthermore, all Illuminate incursions have abruptly ended, and the enemy has disappeared. The victory of Managed Democracy is undeniable. Consult your Galactic Map for more information.

Major Order | A2-4-6 Liberate Key Strategic Worlds is issued | Objective: Liberate (2025-04-29 15:44  UTC)<br/>
Dispatch: NEW MAJOR ORDER. The Meridian Singularity has come to a halt. However, though one enemy is all but annihilated, the Terminids and Automatons remain significant threats. In the Illuminate's final hours, they dealt significant damage to the defenses of multiple strategic sites across both battlefronts, granting the opportunity for our foes to capture formerly well-defended territory. The Helldivers must hold these sites. (2025-04-29 15:44  UTC)<br/>
