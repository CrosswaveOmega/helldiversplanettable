# Helldivers Data Table: About

## What is this website?

This website is, essentially, an interactive table using the in game statistics from Helldivers 2.  
It updates automatically every day at 1pm est.

Data is collated based on individual planets.
All values used from this website are gathered from the Helldivers 2 Community API, found [here](https://github.com/helldivers-2/api).

## What this website displays:


### Base Stats

 *  **Missions Won/Missions Lost:** Count of all missions won or lost on a planet/sector/biome.

 *  **Kills:** All enemies killed on an planet/sector/biome.

 *  **Deaths:** Total count of Helldiver casulties on a planet/sector/biome.

 *  **missionTime:** Supposed to be the total amount of time spent within a mission, but the value is curently broken.

 *  **timePlayed:** Total amount of time players have spent orbiting a specific planet/sector/biome, 
in and out of a mission.



### Derived stats

 *  **KPM:** Kills per mission, the average amount of Terminid and Automaton kills across all missions.

 *  **DPM:** Deaths per mission, the average number of Helldiver Deaths across all missions.

 *  **KTD:** Kills to deaths, this is how enemies a Helldiver will kill before dying.

 *  **WTL:** Wins to Losses, the ratio of wins to losses on this particular planet/sector/biome. 

## What this website does NOT display:

Due to limitations, this website does not display anything related to the liberation rates of planets, as not only does that requires taking constant measurements over time, but the liberation rate is scaled based on the total proportion of players online.
