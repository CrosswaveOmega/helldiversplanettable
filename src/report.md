# Helldivers War History Central: About

## What is this website?

This website is two things.  Firstly, an interactive log of the game history from Helldivers 2, complete with battle trackers and a dynamic recreation of the game map across each in game war day, and interactive tables of the in game statistics from Helldivers 2.  

The statistical tables update automatically every day at 1pm est, though the history log components have to be updated manually.

All values by the Planet/Sector/Biome Tables and Graphs are gathered from the Helldivers 2 Community API, found [here](https://github.com/helldivers-2/api).

The History Data is gathered from Herald/Cobfish's excelllent [Galactic Archive Log](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lvlNVU5aNPcUtPpxAsFS93P2xOJTAt-4HfKQH-IxRaA) and Kejax's [War History Api](https://github.com/helldivers-2/War-History-API).

## What Each Stat means:


### Base Stats

 *  **Missions Won/Missions Lost:** Count of all missions won or lost on a planet/sector/biome.

 *  **Kills:** All enemies killed on an planet/sector/biome.

 *  **Deaths:** Total count of Helldiver casulties on a planet/sector/biome.

 *  **missionTime:** Supposed to be the total amount of time spent within a mission, but the value is curently broken.

 *  **timePlayed:** Total amount of time players have spent orbiting a specific planet/sector/biome, 
in and out of a mission.



### Derived stats

 *  **KPM:** Kills per mission, the average amount of Terminid and Automaton kills across all missions.

 *  **DPM:** Deaths per mission, the average number of Helldiver Deaths across all missions.

 *  **KTD:** Kills to deaths, this is how enemies a Helldiver will kill before dying.

 *  **WTL:** Wins to Losses, the ratio of wins to losses on this particular planet/sector/biome. 

## What this website does NOT display:

Due to limitations, this website does not display anything related to the liberation rates of planets, as not only does that requires taking constant measurements over time, but the liberation rate is scaled based on the total proportion of players online.
