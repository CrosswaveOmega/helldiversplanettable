# Helldivers War History Central: About

## What is this website?

This website is two things.  Firstly, an interactive log of the game history from Helldivers 2, complete with battle trackers and a dynamic recreation of the game map across each in game war day.

The second is interactive tables of the in game statistics from Helldivers 2.  

The statistical tables update automatically every day at 1pm est, and the History Log updates daily at 12:25pm est.

All values by the Planet/Sector/Biome Tables and Graphs are gathered from the Helldivers 2 Community API, found [here](https://github.com/helldivers-2/api).

The History Data is gathered from Herald/Cobfish's excelllent [Galactic War Timeline](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lvlNVU5aNPcUtPpxAsFS93P2xOJTAt-4HfKQH-IxRaA) and Kejax's [War History Api](https://github.com/helldivers-2/War-History-API).


## Why do we need this?

One of the things that sets Helldivers 2 apart from other live service titles is how every operation is part of one giant galactic war, where the combined efforts of all players interact with an ever evolving conflict. The entire playerbase has a hand in shaping the greater story of the Second Galactic War through the sum of its past actions.  

For new players, having to catch up on the older game events is a daunting task.  Even with the community's veterans, at times we may misremember events and this can distort our perception of events resulting in self-gaslighting or even community gaslighting.  By having a down to the minutes log of everything that has happened we prevent these mistakes from happening. By using external sources beyond our memory we can also better envision the state of the game with visuals and data.  
  
The consequences for failing to record the history of our actions has already manifested.  The community is missing quite a bit of data from Feb-March 2024, including the earliest dispatch messages.  This lack of data lead to a semi-famous incident with a Fake Major Order.  The community had collectively misremembered and gaslighted itself into a MO existed during the time of another one. It took many hours of work and convincing by showing the raw data facts to fix this error. In the end the damage was still done, but its things like these that historical logs help to prevent.

That is why the [Galactic War Timeline](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lvlNVU5aNPcUtPpxAsFS93P2xOJTAt-4HfKQH-IxRaA) exists, so the community has a universal, verifiable resource we can draw our history from.  This website serves as extension of the document, recreating the war as it happens while tallying up the combined battles for each planet and sector.

This website and the [Galactic War Timeline](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lvlNVU5aNPcUtPpxAsFS93P2xOJTAt-4HfKQH-IxRaA) work together to show, down to a minute accuracy:
 * The Battles for each Planet and sector
 * The owner of each world in real time.
 * When each planet's biome is changed.
 * When the [Supply Lines](https://helldivers.wiki.gg/wiki/Supply_Lines)/Warp Links/[FTL Lines](https://helldivers.fandom.com/wiki/FTL_Lines) for any planet are changed.
 * When any planet is liberated or taken by the enemy.
 * The spread of the Gloom.

in and out of a mission.



### Derived stats

 *  **KPM:** Kills per mission, the average amount of Terminid and Automaton kills across all missions.
